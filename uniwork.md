  <summary> CMP309 - Software Development for Mobile Devices</summary>

  **Overview:** In CMP309, I learned the basics of app development for Android using Java. Throughout the semester, I used Android Studio to create Android applications for smart devices.

  **Assessment:** The assessment involved creating an Android app that met a series of requirements related to industry-standard programming practices, and to deliver a presentation detailing the app's capabilities and features. To meet these requirements, I created an app that would allow users to upload food they had bought, which would then send periodic reminders to the user to eat the food before it went out of date. The app was created with the aim to prevent food waste and reduce money wasted on uneaten food.

**Grade:** A+

<summary> CMP314 - Computer Networking 2</summary>
**Overview:**
CMP314 focused on a wide veriety of networking concepts and introduced advanced technologies, methods, and protocols used by devices to communicate with eachother.

**Assessment:**
The assessment for this module involved conduscting a security evaluation of a network belonging to a fake company, Stark Inc. The requirements were to produce a report containing a detailed network diagram of the devices present on the network, a subnet table, an evaluation of any security weaknesses found, and a critical evaluation of the network design.

**Grade:** A

  <summary> CMP319 - Web Application Penetration Testing</summary>
  
**Overview:**
This module involved learning advanced techniques used by Ethical Hackers to examine the security of web applications. This involved looking critically at the technologies used by web apps and learning how to exploit common security vulnerabilities and bypass authentication mechanisms. The lab work included learning the following techniques:
  - Code injection.
  - Bypassing client side controls, through the manipulation of cookies and URL parameters.
  - Attacking authentication, through attacking session management, discovering design flaws in authentication management, and attacking forgotten password functionality.
  - Cross site scripting.
  - Investigating web server security, by looking at popular web servers and their common vulnerabilities.

**Assessment:**
To conduct a comprehensive web application penetration test of a website, and to produce a document explaining your methodology, findings, and evaluation of the process. I was given a sample website, belonging to a fake pizza restaurant, alongside access to a test user account. To complete the assessment, I used the industry-standard OWASP Web Security Testing Guide alongside tools and techniques demonstrated in the lab work.

  <summary> CMP320 - Advanced Ethical Hacking</summary>
  
**Overview:**
The Advanced Ethical Hacking module focused on using scripting to automate hacking and cybersecurity processes, as well as the tools and techniques used in malware analysis.

**Malware Analysis Assessment:**
Worth 30% of CMP320's final grade, the malware analysis assessment involved using appropriate malware analysis tools and techniques to analyse a malicious sample, and to then provide the findings with a write up in the format of a white paper report. My report covers the investigation of a WannaCry payload.

**Grade:** A

**Scripting Assessment:**
The scripting assessment in CMP320 involved creating a script that included some aspect of Ethical Hacking, Digital Forensics, or Network Security.
For my project, I chose to create a script that could parse through Python code and detect possibly malicious lines of code. Named 'Snake', this script allows for developers to check that libraries they are downloading using Pip are not malicious.
My report on Snake can be found [here](https://encryptedsarah.github.io/coursework/SGardiner_CMP320_Report.pdf)
The GitHub repository for Snake can be found [here](https://github.com/EncryptedSarah/snake)

**Grade:** A+

<summary>CMP308 - Professional Project Planning and Prototyping</summary>

**Overview:** This module focused on teaching professional project management concepts and their place within planning and development of a project. 

**Assessment** Working within a team, the aim of CMP308's assessment was to create a client pitch presentation and a project plan report for our assigned project, which was to create a network health monitoring application. My areas of the report focused on documenting the change management plan, the communications management plan, the cost management plan, and the procurement management plan for the project.

**Grade:** A+
