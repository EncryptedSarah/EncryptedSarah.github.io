  <summary> CMP319 - Web Application Penetration Testing</summary>
  
**Overview**
This module involved learning advanced techniques used by Ethical Hackers to examine the security of web applications. This involved looking critically at the technologies used by web apps and learning how to exploit common security vulnerabilities and bypass authentication mechanisms. The lab work included learning the following techniques:
  - Code injection.
  - Bypassing client side controls, through the manipulation of cookies and URL parameters.
  - Attacking authentication, through attacking session management, discovering design flaws in authentication management, and attacking forgotten password functionality.
  - Cross site scripting.
  - Investigating web server security, by looking at popular web servers and their common vulnerabilities.

**Assessment**
To conduct a comprehensive web application penetration test of a website, and to produce a document explaining your methodology, findings, and evaluation of the process. I was given a sample website, belonging to a fake pizza restaurant, alongside access to a test user account. To complete the assessment, I used the industry-standard OWASP Web Security Testing Guide alongside tools and techniques demonstrated in the lab work.

  <summary> CMP320 - Advanced Ethical Hacking</summary>
  
**Overview**
The Advanced Ethical Hacking module focused on using scripting to automate hacking and cybersecurity processes, as well as the tools and techniques used in malware analysis.

**Malware Analysis Assessment**
Worth 30% of CMP320's final grade, the malware analysis assessment involved using appropriate malware analysis tools and techniques to analyse a malicious sample, and to then provide the findings with a write up in the format of a white paper report. My report covers the investigation of a WannaCry payload.

**Grade:** A

**Scripting Assessment**
The scripting assessment in CMP320 involved creating a script that included some aspect of Ethical Hacking, Digital Forensics, or Network Security.
For my project, I chose to create a script that could parse through Python code and detect possibly malicious lines of code. Named 'Snake', this script allows for developers to check that libraries they are downloading using Pip are not malicious.
My report on Snake can be found [here](https://encryptedsarah.github.io/coursework/SGardiner_CMP320_Report.pdf)
The GitHub repository for Snake can be found [here](https://github.com/EncryptedSarah/snake)

**Grade:** A+
