  <summary> CMP319 - Web Application Penetration Testing</summary>
  This module involved learning advanced techniques used by Ethical Hackers to examine the security of web applications. This involved looking critically at the technologies used by web apps and learning how to exploit common security vulnerabilities and bypass authentication mechanisms. The lab work included learning the following techniques:
  - Code injection.
  - Bypassing client side controls, through the manipulation of cookies and URL parameters.
  - Attacking authentication, through attacking session management, discovering design flaws in authentication management, and attacking forgotten password functionality.
  - Cross site scripting.
  - Investigating web server security, by looking at popular web servers and their common vulnerabilities.
